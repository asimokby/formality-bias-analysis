If you don't have time to go for an exam you can ask your tutor for help with it. You can also look for your own tutors, which can be quite expensive.

You should check to see what your tutor suggests and make sure you do whatever you can to help. In other words do everything you can to avoid this happening.

Air jet technology is applied in certain areas where explosive impact can be avoided. The major concern is with materials that are relatively nonreactive to air and which have a very fast rate of detonation or initiation. Such materials include explosives, metal powders or metal flakes, cellulose, and other solid materials. For these applications, the materials can be fed through a nozzle to generate high-energy bullets at relatively high velocities. To prevent the explosion, a highly pressurized air jet is normally placed at a distance from the moving material. The distance from the moving material to the jet will depend on its velocity and material density, and on the desired range of distance.
